CAMERA
--------------------------------
This will be where I do an in depth look at designing a good FPS and TP camear(s)
I'll start off with a simple scene and try to stick to some standards
	(whatever those might be)

TODO:
See what I can keep from class
Probably make a new vec4 struct
Draw scene using the actual way you draw shapes in opengl
